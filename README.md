# Pentago-Project
Created a playable game interface of Pentago and the AI of the game using Python (with Pygame).

**1. About the Game**
Pentago is a two-player strategy game similar to Connect 4, but with a unique twist! The objective is to get five consecutive pieces in a straight line (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) on a 6×6 board. However, after placing a piece, players must rotate one of the four 3×3 quadrants, adding an extra layer of strategy.

In this version, you play as Green, while the AI opponent plays as Red. The AI adapts to 4 different difficulty levels, providing a challenging and engaging experience.

**2. How to Play**
Place Your Piece – Click on any empty square on the 6×6 board to place your Green piece.
Rotate a Quadrant – After placing a piece, choose which 3×3 quadrant to rotate and in which direction:
Top Left: CCW (1), CW (2)
Top Right: CCW (3), CW (4)
Bottom Left: CCW (5), CW (6)
Bottom Right: CCW (7), CW (8)

**3. AI Takes Its Turn**
The AI places a Red piece and rotates a quadrant.

**4. Win the Game**
Get five in a row before the AI does!
